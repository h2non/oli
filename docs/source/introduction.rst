Oli reference and language specification
========================================

About
-----

Oli aims to be a confortable minimal language for general purposes which
provides a mix of features from common markup languages and some basic
features from programming languages

It has a beutiful, elegant and clean syntax with unobstructive grammar,
that allows to use it for multiple purposes, like creating your own DSL.
It was designed to be mainly consumed by humans

Rationale
---------

Oli aims to be a confortable minimal language for general purposes which
provides a mix of features from common markup languages and some basic
features from programming languages

It has a beutiful, readable and clean syntax with a non-obstructive
grammar, that allows to you to create your own DSL. It was designed to
be mainly consumed by humans

Language Features
-----------------

-  First class primitive types: boolean, number and strings
-  List and data hashmaps support with nested support
-  Data references (formally variables)
-  Copy or extend data structures and values
-  Templaiting with string interpolation support
-  Built-in logical, comparison and math operators

Design Goals
------------

-  Simple but built-in rich features
-  Unobstructive minimal sintax grammar-free
-  Type inference and powerful pattern matching
-  Easy to use nested structures and lists
-  Useful primitive types with semantics association
-  Parser intelligence, it should think more than human
-  Data references as first class support (no more redundancy!)
-  Templating support (why not?)
-  Implements programming languages basic operators
-  Focus on the content, not on the sintax

Oli is useful for
-----------------

-  Create sintax clean and readable configuration files
-  Create you own DSL for general purposes
-  Store human-writable/readable data (like manifest files)
-  Data interchange format for trivial structures
-  Powerful markup-like templating language
