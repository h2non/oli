Oli language's specification and reference
==========================================

Oli is a minimal declarative language, focused on simplicity, elegancy and with built-in rich features.
It is a communitity-driven project based on an open specification

This is the initial `Oli language`_ draft reference and specification documentation.
It aims to cover all the technical details of the language in order to be useful 
for implementation and for language features consulting

Stage
-----
This documentation is a work in progress, and should be considered unfinished 
as the first language version features are still unclosed and under open debating process.
Anyone can join_ to the discussion and help improving Oli
