Oli language's specification and reference
==========================================

Oli is a minimal declarative language, focused on simplicity, elegancy and with built-in rich features.
It is a communitity-driven project based on an open specification

This is the initial `Oli language`_ draft reference and specification documentation.
It aims to cover all the technical details of the language in order to be useful 
for implementation and for language features consulting

Project stage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Oli is still a work in progress precarious beta project.
Please, consider this before take it as a serious stuff

Document stage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This documentation is a **work in progress** and should be considered unfinished 
as the language features are still unclosed and under open debating process.
Anyone can join_ to the discussion and help improving Oli
